              " 'Posting photos of a gun-toting child online, ISIS supporters announced that the groupâ??s youngest soldier has died in combat.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwitter accounts linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham claimed that the child soldier â??got martyredâ?? with his father while fighting for the terrorist group in Syria.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhotos posted on Twitter showed the smiling boy in military fatigues holding weapons that, at times, are almost as large as his body. British media reported that the child was roughly 10 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe photos of the boy first emerged in June, said Charlie Cooper, a researcher who monitors ISIS social media for the London-based Quilliam counter-extremism think tank.\\r\\nIn the past week, Mr. Cooper has noticed the hashtag â??shibal_alBaghdadiâ?? â?? which translates as â??the cub of Baghdadiâ?? â?? on Twitter accounts linked to ISIS.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile ISIS fighters commonly refer to themselves as lions of the Islamic State, Mr. Cooper said, they refer to child soldiers as cubs of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, ISISâ??s self-proclaimed caliph.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbu Ubaidah, the youngest fighter in the Islamic State got martyred with his father by US airstrikes 2 weeks ago. #IS http://t.co/N1PUeXI7iR\\r\\n\\r\\nâ?? \\r\\nIslamic State Times (@ISTimes1) October 07, 2014\\r\\nMr. Cooper first saw ISIS supporters tweeting that the young boy was dead on Sept. 26. And while he says social media often produces fabricated reports to make ISIS seem â??more brutal than it is,â?? the reports of the dead child appear to be coming directly from ISIS. One Twitter account said the boy was killed in a U.S. air strike, though that has not been confirmed.\\r\\n\\r\\nISIS supporters identified the boy as Abu Ubaidah.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??It seems like a very legitimate thing,â?? Mr. Cooper said in a telephone interview Thursday, adding that ISIS is known to use child soldiers. â??I would vouch for it.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nA United Nations report on Iraq this month said children conduct patrols for ISIS, arrest and guard prisoners, carry weapons and are forced to give blood to help injured fighters. While the boy allegedly killed last month was listed as 10, the UN said child soldiers with ISIS are as young 12 and 13 years old.\\r\\nChildren are also frequently used in ISIS propaganda, with photos showing children in â??uniform and parading alongside adults being frequently posted on social media,â?? the UN reported.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??Everyone at NATO headquarters is worried about the use of children by ISIS,â?? said Shelly Whitman, executive director of the Halifax-based Romeo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??If we [Canada] send boots on the ground, weâ??re going to see this face to face,â?? she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, the six-month Canadian mission in Iraq will be limited to air strikes, with a ban on deploying any combat troops on the ground.',\n",

              " 'There is so much fake stuff on the Internet in any given week that weâ??ve grown tired of debunking it all. Fake Twitter fights. Fake DHL ads. Amazing viral video? Nope â?? a Jimmy Kimmel stunt!\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, rather than take down each and every undeservedly viral story that crosses our monitors each week, weâ??re rounding them all up in a quick, once-a-week Friday debunk of fake photos, misleading headlines and bad studies that you probably shouldnâ??t share over the weekend.\\r\\n\\r\\nReady? Hereâ??s what was fake on the Internet this week:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. The Nobel Committee doesnâ??t â??regretâ?? giving President Obama the Peace Prize. According to an invented â??news releaseâ?? uploaded to Scribd by the prominent blogger and anti-war activist David Swanson, the Nobel Institute canâ??t retract Obamaâ??s 2009 Peace Prize â?? but wishes it could. â??It remains the obligation of the Committee to disassociate itself from actions taken by laureates that frustrate rather than advancing [sic] the fraternity between nations,â?? the statement reads. (Pro-tip: International organizations rarely make glaring grammatical errors in major statements.) â??The Committee therefore joins with the public statements of several Nobel Peace Laureates in expressing its regrets over the conduct of the 2009 prize recipient.â?? The announcement has since been picked up by a number of right-wing outlets, including Before Itâ??s News. The only problem, of course: It isnâ??t true.\\r\\n\\r\\nDear Internet: The Nobel committee â?³regretsâ?? giving Obama the 2009 peace prize story is bogus. I just spoke with the head of the institute\\r\\n\\r\\n2. There is no-such thing as a â??pumpkin-spice-flavored condom.â?? Though considering the social media response to the idea, some enterprising company may want to give it a try. A Photoshopped image of the â??limited editionâ?? Durex condom circulated widely on Twitter and Facebook last week before a punny statement from Durex punctured the hoax: â??We canâ??t claim this one,â?? the company said, â??but we do love it when people spice it up in the bedroom.â?? Har har. In unrelated pumpkin-spice news, the limited-edition Oreos of the flavor are apparently quite real.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeâ??ve officially reached Pumpkin Spice saturation point. pic.twitter.com/Tve77ov5JZ\\r\\n\\r\\n3. No one expects â??record-shattering snowfallâ?? this year. That claim â?? like so many others! â?? comes from the unfunny â??satiristsâ?? at EmpireNews.net, increasingly our least favorite fake-news site in a generally unfavorable field. According to the story and its accompanying map, meteorologists have expected â??above normal snowfallâ?? in huge swaths of the United States, including the entire mid-Atlantic coast. Like everything else on Empire News, of course, the map is fake. Moreover, itâ??s so difficult to predict seasonal weather patterns that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration doesnâ??t bust theirs out until November, and the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Md., told the Baltimore Sun they have virtually no idea what the snow will look like three long months from now.\\r\\n\\r\\n#InOtherNews I just read a report that a meteorologist said we will be having â?³record shattering snowfallâ?? this winter. Lord Jesus.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. â??Male birth controlâ?? will probably not be here by 2017. A number of outlets gleefully proclaimed the news that a â??male birth controlâ?? injection, called Vasalgel, would be hitting the worldâ??s bedrooms within three years. Alas, that would seem to suggest that Vasalgel has been proven to work in humans, or that itâ??s already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration â?? and neither of those things are true. â??The news came from a press release â?? and call for donations! â?? by the foundation behind Vasalgel,â?? Julia Belluz explained at Vox, â??highlighting some promising (though again, unpublished, anecdotal findings) from testing on baboons.â?? Bottom line: Itâ??s great that someoneâ??s working on male birth control, but itâ??s highly unlikely this particular product will reach the U.S. market by 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. There was not a shooting at a California Marine Corps base. An anonymous Facebook page sparked all-out panic at a base north of San Diego on Thursday night when it posted that a shooter was active at the military installation and that â??ALL MARINES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO LOCK THEMSELVES INSIDE OF THEIR ROOMS.â?? The page then stupidly followed that prank post up with a number of â??updatesâ?? on the situation, which were liked and shared hundreds of times. Base police told Business Insider there was no evidence at all of a shooting: People â??saw if on social media networks and then they started telling their friends,â?? one dispatcher said. â??Itâ??s all rumor, itâ??s all hearsay.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nPossible shooter in Camp Pendleton!? Anybody hear anything??\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Shakira is not dead. The singerâ??s hips donâ??t lie, but the Internet does. Constantly. A hoax e-mail bearing the logo of Mexican newspaper El Universal claimed that Shakira died in a car accident in Colombia last week, and that an attached Word document contained â??exclusive images and detailsâ?? from the scene. Colombiaâ??s Informador reports that the e-mail may actually have contained a virus or phishing scam. As for Shakira, sheâ??s alive and well and expecting her second child with boyfriend Gerard Pique.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. British Muslims are not trying to outlaw a beloved childrenâ??s TV show.

(Pro-tip: International organizations rarely make glaring grammatical errors in major statements.) â??The Committee therefore joins with the public statements of several Nobel Peace Laureates in expressing its regrets over the conduct of the 2009 prize recipient.â?? The announcement has since been picked up by a number of right-wing outlets, including Before Itâ??s News. The only problem, of course: It isnâ??t true.\\r\\n\\r\\nDear Internet: The Nobel committee â?³regretsâ?? giving Obama the 2009 peace prize story is bogus. I just spoke with the head of the institute\\r\\n\\r\\n2. There is no-such thing as a â??pumpkin-spice-flavored condom.â?? Though considering the social media response to the idea, some enterprising company may want to give it a try. A Photoshopped image of the â??limited editionâ?? Durex condom circulated widely on Twitter and Facebook last week before a punny statement from Durex punctured the hoax: â??We canâ??t claim this one,â?? the company said, â??but we do love it when people spice it up in the bedroom.â??

In unrelated pumpkin-spice news, the limited-edition Oreos of the flavor are apparently quite real.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeâ??ve officially reached Pumpkin Spice saturation point. pic.twitter.com/Tve77ov5JZ\\r\\n\\r\\n3. No one expects â??record-shattering snowfallâ?? this year. That claim â?? like so many others! â?? comes from the unfunny â??satiristsâ?? at EmpireNews.net, increasingly our least favorite fake-news site in a generally unfavorable field. According to the story and its accompanying map, meteorologists have expected â??above normal snowfallâ?? in huge swaths of the United States, including the entire mid-Atlantic coast. Like everything else on Empire News, of course, the map is fake. Moreover, itâ??s so difficult to predict seasonal weather patterns that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration doesnâ??t bust theirs out until November, and the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Md., told the Baltimore Sun they have virtually no idea what the snow will look like three long months from now.\\r\\n\\r\\n#InOtherNews I just read a report that a meteorologist said we will be having â?³record shattering snowfallâ?? this winter.

A number of outlets gleefully proclaimed the news that a â??male birth controlâ?? injection, called Vasalgel, would be hitting the worldâ??s bedrooms within three years. Alas, that would seem to suggest that Vasalgel has been proven to work in humans, or that itâ??s already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration â?? and neither of those things are true. â??The news came from a press release â?? and call for donations! â?? by the foundation behind Vasalgel,â?? Julia Belluz explained at Vox, â??highlighting some promising (though again, unpublished, anecdotal findings) from testing on baboons.â?? Bottom line: Itâ??s great that someoneâ??s working on male birth control, but itâ??s highly unlikely this particular product will reach the U.S. market by 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. There was not a shooting at a California Marine Corps base. An anonymous Facebook page sparked all-out panic at a base north of San Diego on Thursday night when it posted that a shooter was active at the military installation and that â??ALL MARINES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO LOCK THEMSELVES INSIDE OF THEIR ROOMS.â?? The page then stupidly followed that prank post up with a number of â??updatesâ?? on the situation, which were liked and shared hundreds of times. Base police told Business Insider there was no evidence at all of a shooting: People â??saw if on social media networks and then they started telling their friends,â?? one dispatcher said. â??Itâ??s all rumor, itâ??s all hearsay.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nPossible shooter in Camp Pendleton!?

A hoax e-mail bearing the logo of Mexican newspaper El Universal claimed that Shakira died in a car accident in Colombia last week, and that an attached Word document contained â??exclusive images and detailsâ?? from the scene. Colombiaâ??s Informador reports that the e-mail may actually have contained a virus or phishing scam. As for Shakira, sheâ??s alive and well and expecting her second child with boyfriend Gerard Pique.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. British Muslims are not trying to outlaw a beloved childrenâ??s TV show. A comedian going by the name Zayn Sheikh outraged many Brits (and fooled a number of news outlets, British and otherwise) with a YouTube video that demanded the TV show â??Peppa Pigâ?? go off air and suggested a national campaign would soon organize for that purpose. Peppa Pig is a beloved, alliterative British cartoon character â?? and also â??haram,â?? or forbidden to Muslims, Sheikh claimed. Over the weekend, Sheikh posted a second video admitting the whole thing was a hoax â?? but a hoax for a cause. â??This video served to show how much Islamophobia is around, for those who deny its existence,â?? he wrote. â??It is sad to live in a society where some feel that Muslims have no rights to talk at all.â??\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Obama will not â??resign amid new Benghazi revelations.â?? Every word of this headline is a dream come true to some of the presidentâ??s more conspiracy-minded opponents, which perhaps explains why the fake article, from fake-article-generator National Report, went viral in those circles. As of this writing, itâ??s been shared more than 60,000 times on Facebook. Even Donald Trump seems to have fallen for the â??jokeâ??!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the countryâ??I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Just kidding, that tweet is related to another matter entirely.)\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Cocaine has not been found in Coors Light beer. Since this is the second widespread cocaine-in-a-beverage hoax in as many weeks, letâ??s get a few things straight about the alleged phenomenon. First up: This hoax seems to do well because it has some remote, and long ago, bases in fact. (Cocaine-laced sodas and beverages were very popular in ye olden days, around the time of the Civil War.) It also helps that remote traces of coca have been found, at some point in time, in various popular beverages, including Red Bull. That said, no cocaine expose published on a site called Huzlers.com is ever going to be real. Ever. How have 286,000 people shared this stupid thing?\\r\\n\\r\\n10. The ruins of an ancient city were not discovered in the Australian desert. Perhaps the most incredible thing about this faux-story from World News Daily Report â?? besides the number of times people have reposted it to Facebook â?? is the amazingly credulous conversation readers are having in the comments section below it. â??I thought the climate in central Australia had been arid for over 30,000 years,â?? one commenter wrote. â??30,000 people living in the desert? That would require agriculture and irrigation â?¦ Thatâ??s just incredible!â?? Indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid we miss any other notable fake stuff this week?

Alas, that would seem to suggest that Vasalgel has been proven to work in humans, or that itâ??s already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration â?? and neither of those things are true. â??The news came from a press release â?? and call for donations! â?? by the foundation behind Vasalgel,â??

(Pro-tip: International organizations rarely make glaring grammatical errors in major statements.) â??The Committee therefore joins with the public statements of several Nobel Peace Laureates in expressing its regrets over the conduct of the 2009 prize recipient.â?? The announcement has since been picked up by a number of right-wing outlets, including Before Itâ??s News. The only problem, of course: It isnâ??t true.\\r\\n\\r\\nDear Internet: The Nobel committee â?³regretsâ?? giving Obama the 2009 peace prize story is bogus. I just spoke with the head of the institute\\r\\n\\r\\n2. There is no-such thing as a â??pumpkin-spice-flavored condom.â?? Though considering the social media response to the idea, some enterprising company may want to give it a try. A Photoshopped image of the â??limited editionâ?? Durex condom circulated widely on Twitter and Facebook last week before a punny statement from Durex punctured the hoax: â??We canâ??t claim this one,â?? the company said, â??but we do love it when people spice it up in the bedroom.â??

In unrelated pumpkin-spice news, the limited-edition Oreos of the flavor are apparently quite real.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeâ??ve officially reached Pumpkin Spice saturation point. pic.twitter.com/Tve77ov5JZ\\r\\n\\r\\n3. No one expects â??record-shattering snowfallâ?? this year. That claim â?? like so many others! â?? comes from the unfunny â??satiristsâ?? at EmpireNews.net, increasingly our least favorite fake-news site in a generally unfavorable field. According to the story and its accompanying map, meteorologists have expected â??above normal snowfallâ?? in huge swaths of the United States, including the entire mid-Atlantic coast. Like everything else on Empire News, of course, the map is fake. Moreover, itâ??s so difficult to predict seasonal weather patterns that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration doesnâ??t bust theirs out until November, and the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Md., told the Baltimore Sun they have virtually no idea what the snow will look like three long months from now.\\r\\n\\r\\n#InOtherNews I just read a report that a meteorologist said we will be having â?³record shattering snowfallâ?? this winter.

A number of outlets gleefully proclaimed the news that a â??male birth controlâ?? injection, called Vasalgel, would be hitting the worldâ??s bedrooms within three years. Alas, that would seem to suggest that Vasalgel has been proven to work in humans, or that itâ??s already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration â?? and neither of those things are true. â??The news came from a press release â?? and call for donations! â?? by the foundation behind Vasalgel,â?? Julia Belluz explained at Vox, â??highlighting some promising (though again, unpublished, anecdotal findings) from testing on baboons.â?? Bottom line: Itâ??s great that someoneâ??s working on male birth control, but itâ??s highly unlikely this particular product will reach the U.S. market by 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. There was not a shooting at a California Marine Corps base. An anonymous Facebook page sparked all-out panic at a base north of San Diego on Thursday night when it posted that a shooter was active at the military installation and that â??ALL MARINES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO LOCK THEMSELVES INSIDE OF THEIR ROOMS.â?? The page then stupidly followed that prank post up with a number of â??updatesâ?? on the situation, which were liked and shared hundreds of times. Base police told Business Insider there was no evidence at all of a shooting: People â??saw if on social media networks and then they started telling their friends,â?? one dispatcher said. â??Itâ??s all rumor, itâ??s all hearsay.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nPossible shooter in Camp Pendleton!?

A hoax e-mail bearing the logo of Mexican newspaper El Universal claimed that Shakira died in a car accident in Colombia last week, and that an attached Word document contained â??exclusive images and detailsâ?? from the scene. Colombiaâ??s Informador reports that the e-mail may actually have contained a virus or phishing scam. As for Shakira, sheâ??s alive and well and expecting her second child with boyfriend Gerard Pique.\\r\\n\\r\\n7. British Muslims are not trying to outlaw a beloved childrenâ??s TV show. A comedian going by the name Zayn Sheikh outraged many Brits (and fooled a number of news outlets, British and otherwise) with a YouTube video that demanded the TV show â??Peppa Pigâ?? go off air and suggested a national campaign would soon organize for that purpose. Peppa Pig is a beloved, alliterative British cartoon character â?? and also â??haram,â?? or forbidden to Muslims, Sheikh claimed. Over the weekend, Sheikh posted a second video admitting the whole thing was a hoax â?? but a hoax for a cause. â??This video served to show how much Islamophobia is around, for those who deny its existence,â?? he wrote. â??It is sad to live in a society where some feel that Muslims have no rights to talk at all.â??\\r\\n\\r\\n8. Obama will not â??resign amid new Benghazi revelations.â?? Every word of this headline is a dream come true to some of the presidentâ??s more conspiracy-minded opponents, which perhaps explains why the fake article, from fake-article-generator National Report, went viral in those circles. As of this writing, itâ??s been shared more than 60,000 times on Facebook. Even Donald Trump seems to have fallen for the â??jokeâ??!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the countryâ??I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!\\r\\n\\r\\n(Just kidding, that tweet is related to another matter entirely.)\\r\\n\\r\\n9. Cocaine has not been found in Coors Light beer. Since this is the second widespread cocaine-in-a-beverage hoax in as many weeks, letâ??s get a few things straight about the alleged phenomenon. First up: This hoax seems to do well because it has some remote, and long ago, bases in fact. (Cocaine-laced sodas and beverages were very popular in ye olden days, around the time of the Civil War.) It also helps that remote traces of coca have been found, at some point in time, in various popular beverages, including Red Bull. That said, no cocaine expose published on a site called Huzlers.com is ever going to be real. Ever. How have 286,000 people shared this stupid thing?\\r\\n\\r\\n10. The ruins of an ancient city were not discovered in the Australian desert. Perhaps the most incredible thing about this faux-story from World News Daily Report â?? besides the number of times people have reposted it to Facebook â?? is the amazingly credulous conversation readers are having in the comments section below it. â??I thought the climate in central Australia had been arid for over 30,000 years,â?? one commenter wrote. â??30,000 people living in the desert? That would require agriculture and irrigation â?¦ Thatâ??s just incredible!â?? Indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDid we miss any other notable fake stuff this week?

Alas, that would seem to suggest that Vasalgel has been proven to work in humans, or that itâ??s already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration â?? and neither of those things are true. â??The news came from a press release â?? and call for donations! â?? by the foundation behind Vasalgel,â??

John Kirby said when asked about the video, while stressing that the \"vast majority\" of supplies ended up in the right hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe supplies were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobani that lies near the Turkish border. The militant Islamic State has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all, 28 bundles of equipment -- including medical supplies, weapons and ammunition -- were dropped. The Pentagon says 27 bundles were received.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren, \"one of those bundles drifted off course.\" But he said \"we subsequently destroyed it with an airstrike.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday, though, Islamic State loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said \"Team USA.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKirby acknowledged the conflicting accounts. \"We\\'re aware that one bundle did not make it into the right hands and you saw the CENTCOM release indicating that they destroyed it from the air,\" he said. \"All of that doesn\\'t take away from the notion that this video is out there and that it could in fact be that bundle. We just don\\'t know.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed Islamic State fighting positions, a building and a large Islamic State unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country\\'s southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.\\r\\n\\r\\nActivists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.\\r\\n\\r\\nSyrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S.-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria.\\r\\n\\r\\nFox News\\' Justin Fishel and Greg Palkot and The Associated Press contributed to this report.',\n",

That would be a very bad look for a new service, and the Times says that HBO doesn't plan on launching until it's satisfied that it can do so without issue.\\r\\n\\r\\n$15/MONTH WOULD MAKE HBO'S SERVICE NEARLY TWICE THE COST OF NETFLIX\\r\\n\\r\\nApple is reportedly one of the partners that HBO could launch its new service with.

The Times notes that HBO's parent company wants to see this service be accessible on platforms like the Roku, Xbox, and PlayStation as well, but it's not clear if discussions are ongoing.

HBO may want to position this service as something distinctly different from its cable service as a way to prevent subscribers from moving online. On the other hand, the $15 per month fee may mean that HBO is earning about as much regardless of how you subscribe. That price would make it tougher to compete with Netflix, but HBO hasn't exactly had trouble finding people willing to pay subscription fees that high in the past.

              " 'Eran Cicurel, an editor at Voice of Israel, has quoted YPG fighters familiar with the situation in Kobani, saying that Gill Rosenberg was not captured by IS.

Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday\\'s IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg\\'s Facebook page. The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story \"mere propaganda\". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel\\'s claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg\\'s capture implausible.

The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state, including Iraq and Syria, for any reason including business and media reporting. Rosenberg, age 31, has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor. In the past 24 hours, an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts, including the northern side that borders Turkey. However, the YPG has mitigated many IS gains, due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north.

Cicurel\\'s claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured. Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday\\'s IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg\\'s Facebook page. The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story \"mere propaganda\". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel\\'s claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg\\'s capture implausible. Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg\\'s capture. The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state, including Iraq and Syria, for any reason including business and media reporting. Rosenberg, age 31, has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor. In the past 24 hours, an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts, including the northern side that borders Turkey. However, the YPG has mitigated many IS gains, due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north. Despite the new information, little is still publicly known about Rosenberg\\'s status at this time. Pro-IS sources are still claiming that she is captured, while other sources are staying quiet.

But he must weigh that against his aversion to the risks that could come with plunging the United States into a country torn apart by an intractable internal conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite House officials have suggested that airstrikes in Syria are an option, though the officials say specific military proposals has not yet been presented to the president.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??Weâ??re actively considering whatâ??s going to be necessary to deal with that threat, and weâ??re not going to be restricted by borders,â?? said Ben Rhodes, Obamaâ??s deputy national security adviser. â??Weâ??ve shown time and again that if thereâ??s a counterterrorism threat, weâ??ll take direct action against that threat, if necessary.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before Foleyâ??s murder, Obama found himself on far different footing in the Middle East than he probably expected in the sixth year of his presidency.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter running for the White House on a pledge to end the Iraq war and then making good on that promise in late 2011, Obama thrust the U.S. military back into Iraq this month with a limited airstrike campaign against Islamic State targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama has said he will not send U.S. combat troops to another ground war in the Mideast. But expanding the airstrikes in Iraq and broadening them to include Syria could mean a lengthy American military commitment in the region that could consume much of Obamaâ??s remaining time in office.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??What we should have learned over the past dozen years in that part of the world is that the use of military power is very unpredictable,â?? said Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvardâ??s John F.

Unlike in Iraq, the battle lines are more clearly drawn. Syria has a host of military players in close proximity to each other, including the Islamic State, the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, mainstream Western-backed rebels and pro-government forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic State is among the groups fighting Assad, meaning a U.S. campaign to weaken the extremists could actually strengthen a leader the White House has sought to push from office.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama could try to counteract that uncomfortable dynamic by also taking strikes against Assad, though that could put the U.S. on the hook for the kind of long-term commitment to rebuilding Syria that he has tried to avoid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe risks are no less troubling if Obama allows the Islamic State to continue having unfettered access to a safe haven in Syria. Politically, it could bolster the argument from his critics that he is overseeing an American retreat on the world stage. It also could give the militants space to strengthen and become a threat not just to U.S. interests in the region, but also to the U.S. at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nObamaâ??s own military leadership made clear in recent days that the threat from the Islamic State cannot be fully eliminated without going after the group in Syria, as well as Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??This is an organization that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,â?? said Army Gen.

That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nTo White House critics, the unappetizing options are the result of Obamaâ??s own foreign policy missteps. They argue that he gave extremists an opening in Iraq by not doing more to reach an agreement with the Iraqi government to leave U.S. forces in the country after 2011. They say his decision to not provide heavy weaponry to more moderate rebel groups in Syria also helped facilitate the Islamic Stateâ??s rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a course correction, Obamaâ??s critics argue, the U.S. will be at greater risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??If we do not do more to assist our Iraqi partners and those moderate Syrians who are fighting ISIL and directly target ISILâ??s leadership and networks in Iraq and Syria, I fear that James Foley will not be the only American to die at their hands,â?? said Sen.

But he must weigh that against his aversion to the risks that could come with plunging the United States into a country torn apart by an intractable internal conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite House officials have suggested that airstrikes in Syria are an option, though the officials say specific military proposals has not yet been presented to the president.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??Weâ??re actively considering whatâ??s going to be necessary to deal with that threat, and weâ??re not going to be restricted by borders,â?? said Ben Rhodes, Obamaâ??s deputy national security adviser. â??Weâ??ve shown time and again that if thereâ??s a counterterrorism threat, weâ??ll take direct action against that threat, if necessary.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before Foleyâ??s murder, Obama found himself on far different footing in the Middle East than he probably expected in the sixth year of his presidency.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter running for the White House on a pledge to end the Iraq war and then making good on that promise in late 2011, Obama thrust the U.S. military back into Iraq this month with a limited airstrike campaign against Islamic State targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama has said he will not send U.S. combat troops to another ground war in the Mideast. But expanding the airstrikes in Iraq and broadening them to include Syria could mean a lengthy American military commitment in the region that could consume much of Obamaâ??s remaining time in office.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??What we should have learned over the past dozen years in that part of the world is that the use of military power is very unpredictable,â?? said Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvardâ??s John F.

Unlike in Iraq, the battle lines are more clearly drawn. Syria has a host of military players in close proximity to each other, including the Islamic State, the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, mainstream Western-backed rebels and pro-government forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic State is among the groups fighting Assad, meaning a U.S. campaign to weaken the extremists could actually strengthen a leader the White House has sought to push from office.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama could try to counteract that uncomfortable dynamic by also taking strikes against Assad, though that could put the U.S. on the hook for the kind of long-term commitment to rebuilding Syria that he has tried to avoid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe risks are no less troubling if Obama allows the Islamic State to continue having unfettered access to a safe haven in Syria. Politically, it could bolster the argument from his critics that he is overseeing an American retreat on the world stage. It also could give the militants space to strengthen and become a threat not just to U.S. interests in the region, but also to the U.S. at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nObamaâ??s own military leadership made clear in recent days that the threat from the Islamic State cannot be fully eliminated without going after the group in Syria, as well as Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??This is an organization that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,â?? said Army Gen.

That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nTo White House critics, the unappetizing options are the result of Obamaâ??s own foreign policy missteps. They argue that he gave extremists an opening in Iraq by not doing more to reach an agreement with the Iraqi government to leave U.S. forces in the country after 2011. They say his decision to not provide heavy weaponry to more moderate rebel groups in Syria also helped facilitate the Islamic Stateâ??s rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a course correction, Obamaâ??s critics argue, the U.S. will be at greater risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??If we do not do more to assist our Iraqi partners and those moderate Syrians who are fighting ISIL and directly target ISILâ??s leadership and networks in Iraq and Syria, I fear that James Foley will not be the only American to die at their hands,â?? said Sen.

But he must weigh that against his aversion to the risks that could come with plunging the United States into a country torn apart by an intractable internal conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite House officials have suggested that airstrikes in Syria are an option, though the officials say specific military proposals has not yet been presented to the president.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??Weâ??re actively considering whatâ??s going to be necessary to deal with that threat, and weâ??re not going to be restricted by borders,â?? said Ben Rhodes, Obamaâ??s deputy national security adviser. â??Weâ??ve shown time and again that if thereâ??s a counterterrorism threat, weâ??ll take direct action against that threat, if necessary.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before Foleyâ??s murder, Obama found himself on far different footing in the Middle East than he probably expected in the sixth year of his presidency.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter running for the White House on a pledge to end the Iraq war and then making good on that promise in late 2011, Obama thrust the U.S. military back into Iraq this month with a limited airstrike campaign against Islamic State targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama has said he will not send U.S. combat troops to another ground war in the Mideast. But expanding the airstrikes in Iraq and broadening them to include Syria could mean a lengthy American military commitment in the region that could consume much of Obamaâ??s remaining time in office.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??What we should have learned over the past dozen years in that part of the world is that the use of military power is very unpredictable,â?? said Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvardâ??s John F.

Unlike in Iraq, the battle lines are more clearly drawn. Syria has a host of military players in close proximity to each other, including the Islamic State, the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, mainstream Western-backed rebels and pro-government forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic State is among the groups fighting Assad, meaning a U.S. campaign to weaken the extremists could actually strengthen a leader the White House has sought to push from office.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama could try to counteract that uncomfortable dynamic by also taking strikes against Assad, though that could put the U.S. on the hook for the kind of long-term commitment to rebuilding Syria that he has tried to avoid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe risks are no less troubling if Obama allows the Islamic State to continue having unfettered access to a safe haven in Syria. Politically, it could bolster the argument from his critics that he is overseeing an American retreat on the world stage. It also could give the militants space to strengthen and become a threat not just to U.S. interests in the region, but also to the U.S. at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nObamaâ??s own military leadership made clear in recent days that the threat from the Islamic State cannot be fully eliminated without going after the group in Syria, as well as Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??This is an organization that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,â?? said Army Gen.

That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nTo White House critics, the unappetizing options are the result of Obamaâ??s own foreign policy missteps. They argue that he gave extremists an opening in Iraq by not doing more to reach an agreement with the Iraqi government to leave U.S. forces in the country after 2011. They say his decision to not provide heavy weaponry to more moderate rebel groups in Syria also helped facilitate the Islamic Stateâ??s rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a course correction, Obamaâ??s critics argue, the U.S. will be at greater risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??If we do not do more to assist our Iraqi partners and those moderate Syrians who are fighting ISIL and directly target ISILâ??s leadership and networks in Iraq and Syria, I fear that James Foley will not be the only American to die at their hands,â?? said Sen.

But he must weigh that against his aversion to the risks that could come with plunging the United States into a country torn apart by an intractable internal conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite House officials have suggested that airstrikes in Syria are an option, though the officials say specific military proposals has not yet been presented to the president.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??Weâ??re actively considering whatâ??s going to be necessary to deal with that threat, and weâ??re not going to be restricted by borders,â?? said Ben Rhodes, Obamaâ??s deputy national security adviser. â??Weâ??ve shown time and again that if thereâ??s a counterterrorism threat, weâ??ll take direct action against that threat, if necessary.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before Foleyâ??s murder, Obama found himself on far different footing in the Middle East than he probably expected in the sixth year of his presidency.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter running for the White House on a pledge to end the Iraq war and then making good on that promise in late 2011, Obama thrust the U.S. military back into Iraq this month with a limited airstrike campaign against Islamic State targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama has said he will not send U.S. combat troops to another ground war in the Mideast. But expanding the airstrikes in Iraq and broadening them to include Syria could mean a lengthy American military commitment in the region that could consume much of Obamaâ??s remaining time in office.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??What we should have learned over the past dozen years in that part of the world is that the use of military power is very unpredictable,â?? said Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvardâ??s John F.

Unlike in Iraq, the battle lines are more clearly drawn. Syria has a host of military players in close proximity to each other, including the Islamic State, the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, mainstream Western-backed rebels and pro-government forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic State is among the groups fighting Assad, meaning a U.S. campaign to weaken the extremists could actually strengthen a leader the White House has sought to push from office.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama could try to counteract that uncomfortable dynamic by also taking strikes against Assad, though that could put the U.S. on the hook for the kind of long-term commitment to rebuilding Syria that he has tried to avoid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe risks are no less troubling if Obama allows the Islamic State to continue having unfettered access to a safe haven in Syria. Politically, it could bolster the argument from his critics that he is overseeing an American retreat on the world stage. It also could give the militants space to strengthen and become a threat not just to U.S. interests in the region, but also to the U.S. at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nObamaâ??s own military leadership made clear in recent days that the threat from the Islamic State cannot be fully eliminated without going after the group in Syria, as well as Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??This is an organization that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,â?? said Army Gen.

That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nTo White House critics, the unappetizing options are the result of Obamaâ??s own foreign policy missteps. They argue that he gave extremists an opening in Iraq by not doing more to reach an agreement with the Iraqi government to leave U.S. forces in the country after 2011. They say his decision to not provide heavy weaponry to more moderate rebel groups in Syria also helped facilitate the Islamic Stateâ??s rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a course correction, Obamaâ??s critics argue, the U.S. will be at greater risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??If we do not do more to assist our Iraqi partners and those moderate Syrians who are fighting ISIL and directly target ISILâ??s leadership and networks in Iraq and Syria, I fear that James Foley will not be the only American to die at their hands,â?? said Sen.

But he must weigh that against his aversion to the risks that could come with plunging the United States into a country torn apart by an intractable internal conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite House officials have suggested that airstrikes in Syria are an option, though the officials say specific military proposals has not yet been presented to the president.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??Weâ??re actively considering whatâ??s going to be necessary to deal with that threat, and weâ??re not going to be restricted by borders,â?? said Ben Rhodes, Obamaâ??s deputy national security adviser. â??Weâ??ve shown time and again that if thereâ??s a counterterrorism threat, weâ??ll take direct action against that threat, if necessary.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before Foleyâ??s murder, Obama found himself on far different footing in the Middle East than he probably expected in the sixth year of his presidency.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter running for the White House on a pledge to end the Iraq war and then making good on that promise in late 2011, Obama thrust the U.S. military back into Iraq this month with a limited airstrike campaign against Islamic State targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama has said he will not send U.S. combat troops to another ground war in the Mideast. But expanding the airstrikes in Iraq and broadening them to include Syria could mean a lengthy American military commitment in the region that could consume much of Obamaâ??s remaining time in office.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??What we should have learned over the past dozen years in that part of the world is that the use of military power is very unpredictable,â?? said Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvardâ??s John F.

Unlike in Iraq, the battle lines are more clearly drawn. Syria has a host of military players in close proximity to each other, including the Islamic State, the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, mainstream Western-backed rebels and pro-government forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic State is among the groups fighting Assad, meaning a U.S. campaign to weaken the extremists could actually strengthen a leader the White House has sought to push from office.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama could try to counteract that uncomfortable dynamic by also taking strikes against Assad, though that could put the U.S. on the hook for the kind of long-term commitment to rebuilding Syria that he has tried to avoid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe risks are no less troubling if Obama allows the Islamic State to continue having unfettered access to a safe haven in Syria. Politically, it could bolster the argument from his critics that he is overseeing an American retreat on the world stage. It also could give the militants space to strengthen and become a threat not just to U.S. interests in the region, but also to the U.S. at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nObamaâ??s own military leadership made clear in recent days that the threat from the Islamic State cannot be fully eliminated without going after the group in Syria, as well as Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??This is an organization that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,â?? said Army Gen.

That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nTo White House critics, the unappetizing options are the result of Obamaâ??s own foreign policy missteps. They argue that he gave extremists an opening in Iraq by not doing more to reach an agreement with the Iraqi government to leave U.S. forces in the country after 2011. They say his decision to not provide heavy weaponry to more moderate rebel groups in Syria also helped facilitate the Islamic Stateâ??s rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a course correction, Obamaâ??s critics argue, the U.S. will be at greater risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??If we do not do more to assist our Iraqi partners and those moderate Syrians who are fighting ISIL and directly target ISILâ??s leadership and networks in Iraq and Syria, I fear that James Foley will not be the only American to die at their hands,â?? said Sen.

But he must weigh that against his aversion to the risks that could come with plunging the United States into a country torn apart by an intractable internal conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite House officials have suggested that airstrikes in Syria are an option, though the officials say specific military proposals has not yet been presented to the president.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??Weâ??re actively considering whatâ??s going to be necessary to deal with that threat, and weâ??re not going to be restricted by borders,â?? said Ben Rhodes, Obamaâ??s deputy national security adviser. â??Weâ??ve shown time and again that if thereâ??s a counterterrorism threat, weâ??ll take direct action against that threat, if necessary.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before Foleyâ??s murder, Obama found himself on far different footing in the Middle East than he probably expected in the sixth year of his presidency.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter running for the White House on a pledge to end the Iraq war and then making good on that promise in late 2011, Obama thrust the U.S. military back into Iraq this month with a limited airstrike campaign against Islamic State targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama has said he will not send U.S. combat troops to another ground war in the Mideast. But expanding the airstrikes in Iraq and broadening them to include Syria could mean a lengthy American military commitment in the region that could consume much of Obamaâ??s remaining time in office.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??What we should have learned over the past dozen years in that part of the world is that the use of military power is very unpredictable,â?? said Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvardâ??s John F.

Unlike in Iraq, the battle lines are more clearly drawn. Syria has a host of military players in close proximity to each other, including the Islamic State, the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, mainstream Western-backed rebels and pro-government forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic State is among the groups fighting Assad, meaning a U.S. campaign to weaken the extremists could actually strengthen a leader the White House has sought to push from office.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama could try to counteract that uncomfortable dynamic by also taking strikes against Assad, though that could put the U.S. on the hook for the kind of long-term commitment to rebuilding Syria that he has tried to avoid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe risks are no less troubling if Obama allows the Islamic State to continue having unfettered access to a safe haven in Syria. Politically, it could bolster the argument from his critics that he is overseeing an American retreat on the world stage. It also could give the militants space to strengthen and become a threat not just to U.S. interests in the region, but also to the U.S. at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nObamaâ??s own military leadership made clear in recent days that the threat from the Islamic State cannot be fully eliminated without going after the group in Syria, as well as Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??This is an organization that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,â?? said Army Gen.

That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nTo White House critics, the unappetizing options are the result of Obamaâ??s own foreign policy missteps. They argue that he gave extremists an opening in Iraq by not doing more to reach an agreement with the Iraqi government to leave U.S. forces in the country after 2011. They say his decision to not provide heavy weaponry to more moderate rebel groups in Syria also helped facilitate the Islamic Stateâ??s rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a course correction, Obamaâ??s critics argue, the U.S. will be at greater risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??If we do not do more to assist our Iraqi partners and those moderate Syrians who are fighting ISIL and directly target ISILâ??s leadership and networks in Iraq and Syria, I fear that James Foley will not be the only American to die at their hands,â?? said Sen.

But he must weigh that against his aversion to the risks that could come with plunging the United States into a country torn apart by an intractable internal conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite House officials have suggested that airstrikes in Syria are an option, though the officials say specific military proposals has not yet been presented to the president.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??Weâ??re actively considering whatâ??s going to be necessary to deal with that threat, and weâ??re not going to be restricted by borders,â?? said Ben Rhodes, Obamaâ??s deputy national security adviser. â??Weâ??ve shown time and again that if thereâ??s a counterterrorism threat, weâ??ll take direct action against that threat, if necessary.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before Foleyâ??s murder, Obama found himself on far different footing in the Middle East than he probably expected in the sixth year of his presidency.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter running for the White House on a pledge to end the Iraq war and then making good on that promise in late 2011, Obama thrust the U.S. military back into Iraq this month with a limited airstrike campaign against Islamic State targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama has said he will not send U.S. combat troops to another ground war in the Mideast. But expanding the airstrikes in Iraq and broadening them to include Syria could mean a lengthy American military commitment in the region that could consume much of Obamaâ??s remaining time in office.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??What we should have learned over the past dozen years in that part of the world is that the use of military power is very unpredictable,â?? said Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvardâ??s John F.

Unlike in Iraq, the battle lines are more clearly drawn. Syria has a host of military players in close proximity to each other, including the Islamic State, the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, mainstream Western-backed rebels and pro-government forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic State is among the groups fighting Assad, meaning a U.S. campaign to weaken the extremists could actually strengthen a leader the White House has sought to push from office.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama could try to counteract that uncomfortable dynamic by also taking strikes against Assad, though that could put the U.S. on the hook for the kind of long-term commitment to rebuilding Syria that he has tried to avoid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe risks are no less troubling if Obama allows the Islamic State to continue having unfettered access to a safe haven in Syria. Politically, it could bolster the argument from his critics that he is overseeing an American retreat on the world stage. It also could give the militants space to strengthen and become a threat not just to U.S. interests in the region, but also to the U.S. at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nObamaâ??s own military leadership made clear in recent days that the threat from the Islamic State cannot be fully eliminated without going after the group in Syria, as well as Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??This is an organization that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,â?? said Army Gen.

That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nTo White House critics, the unappetizing options are the result of Obamaâ??s own foreign policy missteps. They argue that he gave extremists an opening in Iraq by not doing more to reach an agreement with the Iraqi government to leave U.S. forces in the country after 2011. They say his decision to not provide heavy weaponry to more moderate rebel groups in Syria also helped facilitate the Islamic Stateâ??s rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a course correction, Obamaâ??s critics argue, the U.S. will be at greater risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??If we do not do more to assist our Iraqi partners and those moderate Syrians who are fighting ISIL and directly target ISILâ??s leadership and networks in Iraq and Syria, I fear that James Foley will not be the only American to die at their hands,â?? said Sen.

But he must weigh that against his aversion to the risks that could come with plunging the United States into a country torn apart by an intractable internal conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite House officials have suggested that airstrikes in Syria are an option, though the officials say specific military proposals has not yet been presented to the president.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??Weâ??re actively considering whatâ??s going to be necessary to deal with that threat, and weâ??re not going to be restricted by borders,â?? said Ben Rhodes, Obamaâ??s deputy national security adviser. â??Weâ??ve shown time and again that if thereâ??s a counterterrorism threat, weâ??ll take direct action against that threat, if necessary.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nEven before Foleyâ??s murder, Obama found himself on far different footing in the Middle East than he probably expected in the sixth year of his presidency.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter running for the White House on a pledge to end the Iraq war and then making good on that promise in late 2011, Obama thrust the U.S. military back into Iraq this month with a limited airstrike campaign against Islamic State targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama has said he will not send U.S. combat troops to another ground war in the Mideast. But expanding the airstrikes in Iraq and broadening them to include Syria could mean a lengthy American military commitment in the region that could consume much of Obamaâ??s remaining time in office.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??What we should have learned over the past dozen years in that part of the world is that the use of military power is very unpredictable,â?? said Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvardâ??s John F.

Unlike in Iraq, the battle lines are more clearly drawn. Syria has a host of military players in close proximity to each other, including the Islamic State, the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, mainstream Western-backed rebels and pro-government forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Islamic State is among the groups fighting Assad, meaning a U.S. campaign to weaken the extremists could actually strengthen a leader the White House has sought to push from office.\\r\\n\\r\\nObama could try to counteract that uncomfortable dynamic by also taking strikes against Assad, though that could put the U.S. on the hook for the kind of long-term commitment to rebuilding Syria that he has tried to avoid.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe risks are no less troubling if Obama allows the Islamic State to continue having unfettered access to a safe haven in Syria. Politically, it could bolster the argument from his critics that he is overseeing an American retreat on the world stage. It also could give the militants space to strengthen and become a threat not just to U.S. interests in the region, but also to the U.S. at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nObamaâ??s own military leadership made clear in recent days that the threat from the Islamic State cannot be fully eliminated without going after the group in Syria, as well as Iraq.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??This is an organization that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,â?? said Army Gen.

That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.â??\\r\\n\\r\\nTo White House critics, the unappetizing options are the result of Obamaâ??s own foreign policy missteps. They argue that he gave extremists an opening in Iraq by not doing more to reach an agreement with the Iraqi government to leave U.S. forces in the country after 2011. They say his decision to not provide heavy weaponry to more moderate rebel groups in Syria also helped facilitate the Islamic Stateâ??s rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a course correction, Obamaâ??s critics argue, the U.S. will be at greater risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??If we do not do more to assist our Iraqi partners and those moderate Syrians who are fighting ISIL and directly target ISILâ??s leadership and networks in Iraq and Syria, I fear that James Foley will not be the only American to die at their hands,â?? said Sen.

They say his decision to not provide heavy weaponry to more moderate rebel groups in Syria also helped facilitate the Islamic Stateâ??s rise.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a course correction, Obamaâ??s critics argue, the U.S. will be at greater risk.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ??If we do not do more to assist our Iraqi partners and those moderate Syrians who are fighting ISIL and directly target ISILâ??s leadership and networks in Iraq and Syria, I fear that James Foley will not be the only American to die at their hands,â?? said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State.\\r\\n\\r\\nObamaâ??s advisers say the responsibility for stemming the rise of the Islamic State does not rest solely with the United States. The White House has been imploring Sunni states in the region â?? Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates in particular â?? to wield their influence with tribal leaders in Iraq and get them to push the Islamic State out of areas they have occupied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. also has been discussing ways that allies such as Britain, France, Australia and Canada can become involved through intelligence sharing, military assistance for Kurdish forces in Iraq and moderate opposition forces in Syria, and if necessary, joining the U.S. in military action.',\n",
